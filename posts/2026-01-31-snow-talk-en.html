        <h1>A Long Talk in the Snow</h1>

        <p>
          This Tuesday, I attended YETI's Demo Day. YETI is an incubator where different teams present their startup projects. The event itself was interesting, but the most interesting part actually happened after it ended.
        </p>

        <p>
          On the way out, I was walking with a German guy I had met there. We chatted briefly near the exit, said goodbye outside, and then started talking again because a few more questions came up. It was snowing, and the conversation kept going deeper. We got so engaged that we stood there in the snow for more than half an hour. Our clothes were soaked, but neither of us noticed while talking.
        </p>

        <p>
          I've been in Germany for quite a while now. This guy is one of the very few Germans I know who is genuinely interested in how the world is changing and keeps his understanding up to date. To be blunt, most people I've met in Germany, young or old, have a noticeably outdated understanding of today's world unless their work is closely tied to China or the U.S., or they have spent real time in one of those countries. Without exaggeration, many people are still operating on a worldview from twenty years ago. Germany itself has seen little real momentum over the past two decades, and relying on local media alone is almost useless for understanding global change.
        </p>

        <p>
          What surprised me was that this guy has never been to China or the U.S. and has lived in Dresden all along, yet his understanding of the world is remarkably current. Our views on technology and the future were highly aligned. In Germany, it is rare for me to find people willing to seriously discuss where the world is heading. On one hand, many people's mental models are stuck in the past. On the other hand, a very common pattern I've observed is that most people are not genuinely interested in global change at all.
        </p>

        <p>
          In my view, today's Germany looks a lot like late-Qing China: still living off past glory, showing limited interest in external change and new things, staying inside its own system while underestimating structural shifts happening in the outside world. If it cannot keep up with the times, the late-Qing outcome may well be Germany's future. Humanity keeps moving forward, but history often repeats itself.
        </p>

        <p>
          Look at Germany’s job market today: compared with ten years ago, the hiring landscape has barely changed. It is hard to find roles focused on autonomous driving, in-vehicle systems, large language models, or humanoid robotics, because these industries still have not reached meaningful scale in Germany or Europe as a whole. Compared with top companies in China and the U.S., both compensation and career ceilings are clearly lower. Over the past twenty years, Germany has missed almost every major technology wave, and it still lacks a new generation of globally influential tech companies (SAP is more enterprise software, and Siemens is more industrial systems; neither represents the kind of company leading today’s technology wave). So I often feel a kind of dissonance: in many ways, today’s Germany feels almost unchanged from the last century. In the last century, Germany was an undisputed world power, but today the situation is completely different, because the world is moving forward while Germany is standing still. More critically, Germany’s foundational industries are under pressure: manufacturing and the automotive industry have entered a structural downturn, old industries are declining, new industries are not taking off, and politicians keep repeating slogans. Many people just want to stay in their comfort zone. They show little concern or interest in the country’s future and little determination to change the status quo. Yet that drive is something I often see in young people in China. Without enough jobs and without enough tax base, Germany’s current social operating system will inevitably face greater pressure. It can still live off its past foundation for now, but I believe this window will not last long. Within ten years, German society will undergo major changes.

          So meeting this German young man was a real bright moment for me. We went deep on topics that are usually hard to discuss here. Before we parted, I told him: you have to keep going and try to help rebuild the future of Germany and Europe!
        </p>

        <p>
          If I were German, I would most likely make this my mission. I genuinely like this country, and since arriving in Germany, I have tried to approach everything here with a learning mindset, and to view things with humility, openness, and tolerance. But the reality is hard to avoid: Germany and Europe are facing very serious problems today. What shocks me even more is that most Germans and Europeans still do not seem to understand this at all, and very few are willing to push for change. Especially over the past two years, as I’ve looked more deeply into how Germany has gradually drifted out of sync with the world and become increasingly marginalized, I have become increasingly certain of one thing: I still have choices. I should move to a better environment to pursue my ideals, rather than keep burning energy in Germany and Europe.
