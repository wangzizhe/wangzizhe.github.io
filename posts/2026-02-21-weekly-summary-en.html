        <h1>Weekly Summary</h1>

          Never give up on a space just because others are already building in it. Real opportunities are often hidden in narrower niches, where many practical needs are still not fully served. In many cases, doing one thing exceptionally well is already enough to create real value.

          Most people do not lack ideas. They lack execution. If someone keeps repeating the same idea for months without shipping an MVP, be careful where you invest your time. Also be cautious of people who stay in the "looking for a technical cofounder" stage for too long. Prototyping has never been easier. People who truly want to build usually ship a minimum viable version first, then discuss collaboration.

          This week, while waiting for the tram, I got so deep in thought that I missed the one right in front of me. It pulled up, stopped, opened its doors, and closed them, and I didn’t notice any of it. I only realized what happened after it had already left. In that moment, it felt like I had entered another world and almost lost awareness of everything around me. Even though I had to wait another 15 minutes in the cold, I was actually a little happy, because it meant I had truly entered a state of flow.

          There is still a major gap between LLMs and AI agents. Many systems-engineering problems cannot be solved by plugging in a model alone. Model capability by itself is rarely enough to deliver product requirements in production. You still need to build the system layer yourself.
