        <h1>The Founder's Nonlinear Capability</h1>

        <p>
          In startup and investing contexts, "nonlinear capability" is mentioned a lot. It often sounds like talent, luck, or a trait reserved for "genius founders."
        </p>
        <p>
          But in my view, <strong>nonlinear capability is not mysticism. It is a capability structure that can be deliberately forged.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          More importantly, it does not come from working harder. It comes from <strong>understanding leverage, uncertainty, and how industry plus technology amplify each other.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>1. Why linear capability often fails in startups</h2>
        <p>Most people are strong at linear capability:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Put in more time, get proportionally more output</li>
          <li>Stabilize, refine, and standardize execution</li>
          <li>Optimize under clear goals and stable rules</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These capabilities are highly valuable in <strong>mature systems</strong>: large companies, established industries, and clear paths.
        </p>
        <p>
          But early-stage startups are not stable systems. They are <strong>high-uncertainty, path-dependent systems</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Startup failure is often not about effort. It is about working on things that <strong>cannot be amplified, even if executed perfectly</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>2. What "founder nonlinear capability" means to me</h2>
        <p>For me, nonlinear capability can be broken down into several concrete parts.</p>

        <h3>1) Intuition for leverage</h3>
        <p>The first layer is not execution. It is judgment:</p>
        <blockquote>Which variables, once true, can amplify outcomes exponentially?</blockquote>
        <p>
          When I shifted from vehicle engineering to deep learning in 2019, it was not because I "liked coding more." It was because I judged that <strong>cars and physical systems were being restructured by software and AI</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          That was not an incremental optimization. It was a directional bet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nonlinear capability often shows up in that choice, not in how hard you grind afterward.
        </p>

        <h3>2) Decision quality × amplifiability, not decision volume</h3>
        <p>
          Founders do not win by making more decisions. They win by making a few decisions at key nodes that can be amplified.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Choosing the track, not polishing features</li>
          <li>Choosing the wedge, not expanding boundaries</li>
          <li>Choosing whether to keep validating or cut quickly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Many smart people fail not because they make poor decisions, but because they keep making good decisions in <strong>low-leverage zones</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>3) Real nonlinearity comes from reversibility, not bravery theater</h3>
        <p>
          On the surface, nonlinear founders can look aggressive. In reality, they are highly sensitive to downside.
        </p>
        <p>What they care about is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Whether failure is controllable</li>
          <li>Whether cost is recoverable</li>
          <li>Whether learning is transferable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Nonlinearity is not all-in gambling. It is <strong>using low-cost experiments to validate high-leverage hypotheses</strong>.
        </p>

        <h3>4) The ultimate form: self-reinforcing systems</h3>
        <p>
          Nonlinearity truly appears when a system starts to amplify itself, and the founder is no longer the growth bottleneck.
        </p>
        <p>This can appear as:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Product-led propagation</li>
          <li>Data/model flywheels</li>
          <li>Workflow embedding</li>
          <li>Network effects or scale effects</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Before that, even a strong founder is still a linear amplifier.</p>

        <h2>3. Why smart and hardworking still does not equal nonlinear</h2>
        <p>This is easy to miss but critical:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>10% technical improvement does not mean 10x business results</li>
          <li>More complex models do not mean stronger moats</li>
          <li>Harder problems do not automatically mean higher value</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I have seen many people who are extremely smart and hardworking. Their issue is not capability. Their issue is that they keep solving <strong>linearly improvable problems</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
          In early startups, what is scarce is not "doing things better." It is <strong>doing the right things that can be amplified</strong>.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Why I use entrepreneurship to forge nonlinear capability</h2>
        <p>For me, entrepreneurship is a brutal but efficient training ground.</p>
        <p>It forces me to face all at once:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Uncertainty</li>
          <li>Real feedback</li>
          <li>Long-horizon game dynamics</li>
          <li>Organizational and human complexity</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          My current core product is essentially an experiment: can I turn personal judgment, technical understanding, and abstraction into <strong>a system the market can repeatedly validate and repeatedly amplify</strong>?
        </p>

        <h2>Closing: nonlinear capability is not a label, but a training outcome</h2>
        <p>
          Nonlinear capability is not a persona line, and not a slogan like "I want to do big things."
        </p>
        <p>It is more like a filter:</p>
        <blockquote>
          If an effort has uncontrollable downside, no amplifiable upside, and no transferable learning, it is probably not a good nonlinear training ground.
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          For me, the meaning of entrepreneurship is not guaranteed success. It is whether I choose to place myself where high-leverage decisions keep happening.
